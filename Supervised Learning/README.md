Workflow stages

The competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.

1) Question or problem definition.
2) Acquire training and testing data.
3) Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
4) Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
5) Model, predict and solve the problem.
6) Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
7) Supply or submit the results.

The workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.

    We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.
    Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.
    Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.
    Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.
